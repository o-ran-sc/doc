The O-RAN Software Community (SC) Documentation

Welcome to O-RAN SC Documentation Home
======================================

O-RAN Alliance members and contributors have committed to evolving
Radio Access Networks (RAN) around the world. Future RANs will be
built on a foundation of virtualized network elements, white-box
hardware and standardized interfaces that fully embrace O-RANâ€™s core
principles of intelligence and openness. An ecosystem of innovative
new products is already emerging that will form the underpinnings of
the multi-vendor, interoperable, autonomous RAN, envisioned by many
in the past, but only now enabled by the global industry-wide vision,
commitment and leadership of O-RAN Alliance members and contributors.

O-RAN SC is partnering with the O-RAN Alliance and Linux Foundation to
support the software development for an open RAN solution that is
available to everyone. The community will align with the architecture
and specifications that are created in the O-RAN Alliance working
groups to create a working software solution to enable an open and
intelligent 5G RAN.

Please find some guidance here on the content of O-RAN SC
documentation.
