This README.txt file is a tutorial of how to create repo documentation.
This is a copy&paste solution of documentation, and there is a step-by-step tutorial of creating documentation on https://wiki.o-ran-sc.org/display/DOC. Both solution work, your can choose a way you prefer.


Tutorial starts here.

Assuming you already git clone doc repo in your local system.

Step 1:

Copy all files in doc/doc-templates/ to your local directory, your_repo/docs/, 

Note: replace your_repo with the repo name you are working on.


Step 2:
Move 'tox.ini' & '.readthedocs.yaml' in doc/docs/repo-root-dir-files/ to your_repo/

Note: 1. replace your_repo with the repo name you are working on.
      2. '.readthedocs.yaml' is not visible by 'ls' or 'll' command, please double check after moving. Better try 'vi .readthedocs.yaml' to check


Step 3:

Choose templates you will have from [api-docs.rst,developer-guide.rst,installation-guide.rst,release-notes.rst,user-guide.rst] for documentation, and finish editing them.

Note: 1. If your don't need any of them, just simply delete the one you do not need. 
      2. Teamplates just provide a guideline for documentation. If you have any specific request, please feel free do it yourself.


Step 4:
Editing index.rst. There is a scetion including what rst files your will have in your repo documentaion, something like following:

#############
example start
#############

Welcome to O-RAN SC your_repo Documentation
===========================================


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:

   overview.rst
   developer-guide.rst
   release-notes.rst
   installation-guide.rst
   user-guide.rst
   api-docs.rst


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

* :ref:`genindex`
* :ref:`modindex`
* :ref:`search`


############

Overview.rst is required for each repo while others are optional. Please delete the line (rst files line) you do not need.
For example if you donot need api-docs:


#############

#############

Welcome to O-RAN SC your_repo Documentation
===========================================


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:

   overview.rst
   developer-guide.rst
   release-notes.rst
   installation-guide.rst
   user-guide.rst


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

* :ref:`genindex`
* :ref:`modindex`
* :ref:`search`


############

Step 5
Editing overview.rst, there is instruction in the file.


Step 6:
Testing your documentation by running 'tox -e docs,docs-linkcheck' command.
If everything correct, you can open your_repo/docs/_build/html/index.html to see it locally.

Step 7:
upload your documentaion patch
